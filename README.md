# Surfs Up
## Overview
The purpose of the analysis is to determine the viability of establishing a surf store in the island of Oahu, Hawaii. To see if it will hold up during winter based upon data gathered from weather stations.

## Results
The total temperatures for the months of June and December were retrieved and a basic statistical analysis was made on them to seek out for notable differences between them.

- First key difference between June and December is obviously the mean temperature the difference is of 4°F, 75°F for June and 71°F for December. At first glance this difference seems little.
- The second notable difference is the highest and lowest temperatures for each month. Meanwhile the highest temperatures of both months are not to seperate away from each other, 
85°F for June and 83°F for December, the lowest temperatures do have a bigger difference between each other, 64°F for June and 56°F for December. These two are outliers, but I believe they should still be taken into account because they are not so far off their lower quartile. Another key aspect that is not in the database but should be investigated is at what time of the day this temperatures were taken or are this averages of the day.
- Finally another key element of both charts is not a difference but the coincidence that their quartiles have the same difference between each other of aproximately 4°F like their means had.
